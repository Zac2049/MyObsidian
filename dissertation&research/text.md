Recent studies have also validated MLP-based models and examined the effectiveness of attention mechanism, convolution, and other modules in CNNs or ViTs. Although CNNs and ViTs have been dominant for some time, the success of certain MLP-based models has had great repercussions. A representative example is MLP-Mixer, proposed by Tolstikhin et al. [32] in May 2021, which used a simple pure deep MLP architecture but showed competitive performance. MLP-Mixer uses per-patch flattening instead of the full flattening, and positional encoding and class token are not added to the patch sequence as in ViT. Following patch embedding learning, the Mixer MLP block is composed of a token-mixing MLP and a channel-mixing MLP, where the former is used to aggregate inter-patch features and the latter is used to integrate intra-patch features. The final class is predicted based on the features obtained following global average pooling.

  

Simultaneously with or following MLP-Mixer, many other MLP-based models have been proposed, .e.g., gMLP [33], ResMLP [34], ASMLP [35], and CycleMLP [36]. MLP-Mixer not only inspired further exploration of MLP-based models but also led to further development of neural architectures in CV. As transformers, CNNs, and MLPs have shown competitive performance against each other, there is still no evidence as to which architecture is more suitable for particular CV learning tasks. In the case of medical image analysis, we provide a comparison of CNN and transformer models in part C of Section 4.

同许多医学图像分割网络一样，GFUNet也是采用encoder和decoder架构。

encoder部分：首先是将图片输入Patch Embedding层，这里的patch embedding源自ViT，我们采用将图片patch化的策略，（这里请将ViT的patch策略描述一遍）输入线性投影层之后，各个patch转化为token，从而将图片的视觉问题转化为一个seq2seq的问题。在Patch Embedding层还需要进行positional encoding，给每一个序列以一个位置编码，这其中进行了一个sum操作。

在进行了必要的patch embedding 之后，我们将一系列序列输入GFBlock（Global Filter Block）层，GFBlock的具体结构，见Fig.3。在GFBlock层中，首先我们对序列进行layer normalization，对于正则化我们都采用layer normalization。再将数据输入Global Filter中，Global Filter是我们方法中的核心，思想其实就是将我们的特征序列先经过傅里叶变换，将时域中的信息转化为频域中的信息。

在GFBlock的结尾，我们又对图像进行了一个reshape的操作（图中并未标出），以方便之后的stage中进行同样的操作，最终完成整个encoder的部分。

经过了encoder部分之后，我们将feature经过Residual Block和上采样。之后对长宽都增大一倍的feature和之前encoder的feature做concatenation，之后再通过卷积以便减少通道数，从而可以重复这个步骤完成decoder的大部分操作。我们也借鉴了nnUNet的框架和monai库。即使以轻量化著称，基于MLP的UNext，在分割精度、模型轻量化程度以及运损耗，也不及GFUNet。

无论是在心脏图像还是在皮肤病病灶分割方面，我们的GFUNet都能取得卓越的成效。在ISIC上，我们依然将GFUNet和基于卷积神经网络、基于transformer和基于新型MLP的UNet网络进行对比，显然也能取得最好的效果。

给出下面四段来自四篇文章的摘要，我有一篇关于在边缘设备上做医学图像分割的文章，请帮我在我这篇文章中写一段话去引用这四篇文章，并在需要引用的地方标1，2，3，4。  
1. In recent years, sEMG (surface electromyography) signals have been increasingly used to operate wearable devices. The development of mechanical lower limbs or exoskeletons controlled by the nervous system requires greater accuracy in recognizing lower limb activity. There is less research on devices to assist the human body in uphill movements. However, developing controllers that can accurately predict and control human upward movements in real-time requires the employment of appropriate signal pre-processing methods and prediction algorithms. For this purpose, this paper investigates the effects of various sEMG pre-processing methods and algorithms on the prediction results. This investigation involved ten subjects (five males and five females) with normal knee joints. The relevant data of the subjects were collected on a constructed ramp. To obtain feature values that reflect the gait characteristics, an improved PCA algorithm based on the kernel method is proposed for dimensionality reduction to remove redundant information. Then, a new model (CNN + LSTM) was proposed to predict the knee joint angle. Multiple approaches were utilized to validate the superiority of the improved PCA method and CNN-LSTM model. The feasibility of the method was verified by analyzing the gait prediction results of different subjects. Overall, the prediction time of the method was 25 ms, and the prediction error was 1.34 ± 0.25 deg. By comparing with traditional machine learning methods such as BP (backpropagation) neural network, RF (random forest), and SVR (support vector machine), the improved PCA algorithm processed data performed the best in terms of convergence time and prediction accuracy in CNN-LSTM model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method (improved PCA + CNN-LSTM) effectively recognizes lower limb activity from sEMG signals. For the same data input, the EMG signal processed using the improved PCA method performed better in terms of prediction results. This is the first step toward myoelectric control of aided exoskeleton robots using discrete decoding. The study results will lead to the future development of neuro-controlled mechanical exoskeletons that will allow troops or disabled individuals to engage in a greater variety of activities.  
2. This paper describes a novel gait pattern recognition method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for lower limb exoskeleton. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) installed on the exoskeleton to collect motion information, which is used for LSTM-CNN input. This article considers five common gait patterns, including walking, going up stairs, going down stairs, sitting down, and standing up. In the LSTM-CNN model, the LSTM layer is used to process temporal sequences and the CNN layer is used to extract features. To optimize the deep neural network structure proposed in this paper, some hyperparameter selection experiments were carried out. In addition, to verify the superiority of the proposed recognition method, the method is compared with several common methods such as LSTM, CNN and SVM. The results show that the average recognition accuracy can reach 97.78%, which has a good recognition effect. Finally, according to the experimental results of gait pattern switching, the proposed method can identify the switching gait pattern in time, which shows that it has good real-time performance.  
3. Performing complex tasks by soft robots in constrained environment remains an enormous challenge owing to the limitations of flexible mechanisms and control methods. In this paper, a novel biomimetic soft robot driven by Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) with light weight and multi-motion abilities is introduced. We adapt deep learning to perceive irregular targets in an unstructured environment. Aiming at the target searching task, an intelligent visual servo control algorithm based on Q-learning is proposed to generate distance-directed end effector locomotion. In particular, a threshold reward system for the target searching task is proposed to enable a certain degree of tolerance for pointing errors. In addition, the angular velocity and working space of the end effector with load and without load based on the established coupling kinematic model are presented. Our framework enables the trained soft robot to take actions and perform target searching. Realistic experiments under different conditions demonstrate the convergence of the learning process and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  
4. The wearable lower limb exoskeleton is a typical human-in-loop human–robot coupled system, which conducts natural and close cooperation with the human by recognizing human locomotion timely. Requiring subject-specific training is the main challenge of the existing approaches, and most methods have the problem of insufficient recognition. This paper proposes an integral subject-adaptive real-time Locomotion Mode Recognition (LMR) method based on GA-CNN for a lower limb exoskeleton system. The LMR method is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based multi-sensor information selection. To improve network performance, the hyper-parameters are optimized by Bayesian optimization. An exoskeleton prototype system with multi-type sensors and novel sensing-shoes is used to verify the proposed method. Twelve locomotion modes, which composed an integral locomotion system for the daily application of the exoskeleton, can be recognized by the proposed method. According to a series of experiments, the recognizer shows strong comprehensive abilities including high accuracy, low delay, and sufficient adaption to different subjects.
